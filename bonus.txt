from pymongo import MongoClient

# create a MongoDB client and connect to to database
client = MongoClient()
db = client.my_database
collection = db.my_collection

# query the collection and return a list of usernames
usernames = [doc['username'] for doc in collection.find({}, {'username': 1, '_id': 0})]



This approach can help reduce the amount of data being queried, which can improve the performance of your application when working with large datasets.
It's always a good practice to only fetch the fields that you need and avoid fetching unnecessary data.
Using a list comprehension is also a concise and efficient way to extract the required data from the returned documents.
